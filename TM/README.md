# Teacher Model (TM)

The main idea of this model is to serve as a basis for university professors to request the service that best suits their needs through a simple guided web form.

This form follows three different flows: creation, modification and deletion.


## Software used

The web application is built on LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, Php). All of them are open source tools that provide the ideal functionality for this purpose.

## SETUP

See SETUP GUIDE for better insights about the process.
