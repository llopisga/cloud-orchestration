# Cloud Orchestration Project

## Overview

Cloud Orchestration is a project carried out as a Final Bachelor's Degree Project, whose objective is to ease the creation of new training environments in the classrooms of educational institutions, allowing teachers and researchers to take advantage of technological tools by quickly facilitate access and organization of information.

To achieve this objective, a system approach on the philosophy of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) has been developed, which starting with non-technical data entered by a user (TM) then it is transformed into a platform-independent model (PIM) that will define the generic system environment, eventually transforming it through Policy-based rules to compose specific code for an interactive web-based platform.

The results of the project will be used in the Ma≈Çopolska Educational Cloud (MCHE), which is an educational environment that connects approximately 150 schools with 10 universities.
