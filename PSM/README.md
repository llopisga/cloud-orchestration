# Platform Specific Model (PSM)

This model is created after the policy-based decisions are taken to select the right implementation for the requested service. It contains the PIM attributes converted and the platform-specific ones.

Structure
--------

- Repositories: Source Code of the PSM used in the system
  - Antidote
  - Jupyter
- Requests: This is where the transformation of the feasible nodes and PSM is housed, which will be the entry point for code/psm.py
